              IT company Version 1 is creating 180 new jobs in Belfast, more

              will be funded through assured skills academies to the value of
              £821,000. Those will be run by Belfast Met and funded by the
              Department for the Economy.

            <p>
              The announcement is dependent on player departures that will allow Barca to fund the Argentina captain's wages.
              
              Messi, 34, was a free agent after his contract - that reportedly paid him £123m a season - expired on 30 June.
              
              He is on holiday after winning the Copa America and the finer details of the contract are yet to be finalised.
              
              There will be a break clause in the contract, allowing Messi to leave the club after two years.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Britney Spears has told a US court she wants to charge her father Jamie for his alleged "conservatorship abuse".
                
                "I'm here to press charges. I'm angry and I will go there," the singer said over a lawyer's phone on Wednesday.
                
                Her emotional statement came as a Los Angeles judge ruled Spears can choose her own lawyer in her fight to end the controversial legal arrangement.
                
                A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions.
